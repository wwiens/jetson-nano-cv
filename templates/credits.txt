PyImageSearch
https://pyimagesearch.com/
I learned a lot about OpenCV & Python from PyImageSearch.
The code here is my own, but was inspired by multiple projects
at PyImageSearch. If you are looking for a resource on Python,
OpenCV and AI, I would highly recommend their website.


NVIDIA Developer

The training section was possible after going through some content
from the NVIDIA Developer website. They have some great resources
and it was their approach to combining training and detection
in a single Jupyter notebook that inspired this project.

The BootStrap template I am using comes courtsey of colorlib.


Range Slider

This range slider from Zaziabo is used for defining the split
for the dataset for training. Cool script.
